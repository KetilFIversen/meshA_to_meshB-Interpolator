# meshA_to_meshB
 
A flexible linear interpolator which can interpolate data between any two sets of
structured or unstructured points. It also has the ability to extrapolate
data on points outside the convex hull of input points (using nearest extrapolation).

Thanks to Jaime on stackoverflow for the excellent linear interpolator function.
